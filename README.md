## WebRtc.NET: WebRTC for C# & C++/CLI

...current way of incorporating the WebRTC libraries into your project is a total nightmare. The build system (aka Ninja http://www.webrtc.org/native-code/development) is extremely complicated. You are going to be doing everything from the command line, it take ages to even download the source code (~10GB), try it and cry... ;D

##### What you get is the compiled code in a static library that you can just throw into your project.
